# Plant-Disease-Detection-Project
Applying AI to Agriculture:

First issue to be solved is Plant Disease Detection.
I also plan to solve Animal Disease Detection and Soil Fertility Level Detection sometime later.
Other functionalities would be added as time goes on / inspiration flows / get a new idea / my skills improve.

I intend to learn Flutter... An AI Agric Assistant would be best utilized as a mobile app.
And finally, it is intended to work entirely offline. Most farms in Africa are located in rural areas. 
Internet Connectivity & Network Latency shouldn't be an issue.
